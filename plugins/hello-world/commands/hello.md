# Hello Command

Welcome! This is a test command from your personal Claude Code plugin marketplace.

When the user runs `/hello`, respond with:

1. A warm greeting
2. Confirm this is coming from the **g-shudy-plugins** marketplace
3. Show the current date and time
4. Give a brief overview of what this marketplace contains:
   - File intelligence tools (FindMedia integration)
   - Obsidian vault automation
   - Personal workflow plugins
   - Developer productivity tools

5. Suggest they explore other plugins: `/plugin list g-shudy-plugins`

Make it friendly and include an appropriate emoji! 🎉
